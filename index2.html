        <h1><b><font color="blue" size="5">In education and employment, some people work harder than others. Why do some people work harder? Is it always a good thing to work hard?</font></b></h1>
        <p><font color="black" size="4"><i>In education and employment, some individuals put in more work in comparison to others. This is mainly because of the notion that the harder you work, the more successful and wealthy you can become, but a surplus of work can have certain negative outcomes because it can not only distract one from family life but can have harmful effects.
          <br>People put their lives into their work, hoping they will be successful and earn a good living. To put it another way, since people desire to have a proper life in which they are financially stable and relatively satisfied with their positions in society, they work day and night. For example, the vast majority (78%) of juveniles in the United States of America work extremely hard to get into good colleges and universities and ultimately to get a well-paid job after graduation. Thus, the primary reasons for working as hard as possible are the ability to buy whatever you want and to live a luxurious life.
          
          <br>Although hard work plays a vital role in living a fulfilling life, it can have negative consequences. This means a high volume of work might cause individuals to be in a circumstance where they do not focus on their families, friends, or relatives but only on their jobs. What's more, an excessive amount of work has a detrimental impact on their mental health, ranging from stress and anxiety to depression and insecurity. To give a clear illustration, Steve Oliver, a worker at Digital Currency, had worked all the time before he realized that he was in a burnout and was hospitalized. Therefore, hard work is not always the best path to strive for affluence, as a plethora of cases like Steve Oliver's have been reported to the public eye day after day. 
          <br>To sum up, humans tend to work hard in order to live in a good financial situation. Working hard, on the other hand, is objectively not the best way to accomplish their goals due to negative consequences, namely the distraction from family life and the heavy workload resulting in depression. As a result, people should make sure they are putting in a sufficient amount of work to live the life they want under conditions where their well-being is completely great.
